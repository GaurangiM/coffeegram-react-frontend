## The Idea üí°
We go on exploring different cities of Netherlands on weekend and are always looking for some good cafes to have our favorite cup of Capuccino. So I thought I should build an app which will have an exclusive collection of cafes reviewed by people who love coffee ! Being a signed up member of CoffeeGram, you can add cafes to list and also post reviews for it. I hope this app helps people who love coffee and some more coffee !

## Features

- Ability to add cafe to list by signing up 
- Ability to view cafe description, pictures, contact details, address and reviews

- Ability to view cafes reviewed by you, on map
